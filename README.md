# End-to-End ETL Data Pipeline for Real-Time Analytics

## **Overview**
This project implements an **end-to-end ETL data pipeline** that:
- **Extracts** data from a local SQL Server database.
- **Transforms** and cleans the data into a business-ready format for analytics.
- **Loads** the processed data into a **Power BI dashboard** for **real-time analytics**.

The pipeline was designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, leveraging **Azure Cloud Services** and following the **Medallion Architecture** approach for batch data processing.
